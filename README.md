# LS-Lab-4 - CI/CD
CI/CD is DevOps practice that automates integration and delivery processes and allows you to regularly release high-quality software. CI will automatically build the software, test it and notify you if something goes wrong. CD will automatically install the code changes on the company's servers and perform additional tests.
